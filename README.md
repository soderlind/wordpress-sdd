# WordPress SDD

Building WordPress products? I just open-sourced a **Spec-Driven Development constitution** for WP. It defines non-negotiables so teams ship faster—and safer: [constitution.md](https://github.com/soderlind/wordpress-sdd/blob/main/constitution.md)

What’s inside:
1. 🔒 Security (nonces, caps, escaping)
2. 🧱 Block-first architecture
3. ✅ WPCS + ESLint/Prettier
4. 🧪 PHPUnit/Jest/Playwright
5. ♿️ A11y, 🌍 i18n
6. 🚀 CI, SemVer, releases

Works with [GitHub **Spec Kit**](https://github.com/github/spec-kit): /speckit.specify → plan → tasks → implement—all bound by the constitution so specs can’t drift.

Use it, fork it, file issues. Make it your team’s source of truth for plugins, themes & headless builds: [constitution.md](https://github.com/soderlind/wordpress-sdd/blob/main/constitution.md)
